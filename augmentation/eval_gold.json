      "general_info": "### **1. Caravan Overview**\n- The salt caravan forms the lifeblood of Western Xia's economy, linking mountain springs to distant markets.\n- Led by seasoned chiefs, each caravan comprises merchants, guards, and support staff traveling in well-organized columns.\n- Caravans rest each evening at fortified waystations, chosen for water and safety.\n- Cooperation between merchants and guards ensures the salt reaches markets intact.\n- The caravan's emblem—a coiled serpent clutching a salt rock—marks all wagons.\n\n### **2. Routes and Risks**\n- Salt travels along several main routes: the Helan Pass, the Ningxia trail, and the desert crossing to Dunhuang.\n- Each route is rated by risk: A (low), B, C, S (extreme), based on bandit activity, terrain, and weather.\n- Higher risk routes offer merchants better prices upon delivery.\n- Caravans carry the Salt Seal, proof of imperial sanction, reducing tolls at checkpoints.\n- Guards accompany the wagons to fend off attacks and ensure discipline.\n\n### **3. Trade and Rewards**\n- Merchants negotiate tariffs in silver taels upon sale of salt.\n- Profits depend on route difficulty, distance covered, and market demand at destination.\n- Occasionally, special cargo—perfumed salts or medicinal salts—fetch premium trade values.\n\n### **4. Preparation and Supplies**\n- Caravans stock dried mutton, millet, and preserved fruits for long journeys.\n- Adequate water, pack animals, and spare caravan wheels are essential.\n- Guides familiar with the desert oases are hired for S-rated desert crossings.\n- Traders often bring barter goods—silks, spices—to trade for local provisions.\n\n### **5. Challenges and Environment**\n- Sandstorms, high passes, and highwaymen pose constant threats.\n- Seasonal river floods can delay the Ningxia trail in summer.\n- Bandit lords may be bribed or confronted by caravan guards.\n- Unity and discipline among caravan members determine success.",
